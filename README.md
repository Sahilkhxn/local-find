# LocalFind 🏪

> Find your local shop in seconds.

LocalFind is a hyperlocal shopping platform where users search for any item and nearby registered shops instantly respond on WhatsApp — including price quotes that are shown only to that specific user.

---

## 📸 Features

- 🔍 **Item Search** — user searches for anything, all shops within 5km get notified instantly
- 🔔 **Real-time WhatsApp Notification** — shops receive requests directly on WhatsApp
- 🔒 **Private Pricing** — the price a shop quotes is visible only to that user, not publicly
- 📱 **Dual WhatsApp Number** — shop can add 2 numbers; if one number replies first, the other automatically gets a "reply already sent" message
- 📍 **Location-based Filtering** — exact distance calculated using the Haversine formula
- ✅ **No App Needed** — WhatsApp is enough for both users and shopkeepers

## 📱 Dual WhatsApp Number — How It Works

```
User sends a request
        ↓
Both numbers receive notification
        ↓
Number 1 replies first ✅
        ↓
Bot sends message to Number 2:
"This order was already replied to from Number 1"
        ↓
Order locked — no duplicate reply possible
```
